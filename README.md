# Advent of Code 2020 Solutions
This repository contains code that solves all 25 problems of the Advent of Code 2020 challenge. Solutions mostly written in C++, while a few are in python.

## How to run
If `.py` file:
```
python file.py < input.txt
```
If `.cpp` file:
```
gcc file.cpp -o file
./file < input.txt
```

## What I learned
* Standard Template Library (STL) objects such as maps, sets, vectors, etc.
* C++ Streams (input / output / string / bit / etc streams)
* Coding with iterator patterns
* Efficient algorithms such as the [Chinese Remainder Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem)
* Recursive pattern matching algorithms, string parsing, and Regex
